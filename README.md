## Built with

pure css and html

## What I learned

i learned about aspect ratio and they way to calculate and maintain it also about image as to keep at 100%. i learned a lot about grid and flex and i knew already about them but went through many different scenarios here so i am confident i know better now comapratively.I also learned abut object fit they to toggle hamburger menu using only css and to use translate if there isn't any other option to things around.I also learned about the children and parent behave when one property is applied to other.
